You have 'background-color: #0000FF;", instead of 'background-color: #000033;' in header{}. There are two text-align: center;, but you should only have one. You created two selection CSS id's but the system only asked you to defined a CSS selector 'selection' only. There is a '.section-container' which is not correct. There should be separate h2{} definition. The 'text-decoration: none;' option should not be part of the 'header a:link' and header a:visited'. You are missing the 'header a'. You are missing 'font-weight: bold;' in 'nav'. The '#homehero' is not correct as well as it is unclear why there is a "#homehero img'. The '#yurthero' should have 300px instead of '100%'. You are missing a h3{} definition. You should only have the 'list- style-image' in the 'main ul'
descendant. You are missing dt, .resort, and #contact. index.html: This webpage does not display the correct opening web page as shown in Figure 7.46. yurts.html: You have major issues. activities.html: You have major issues."
